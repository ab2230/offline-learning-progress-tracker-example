Offline Learning Progress Tracker
A minimal offline-first demo showing how students can work fully offline and sync later when the internet is available.

Frontend: Expo (React Native) app in offline-app-example/
Backend: Express mock server in backend-offline-app/
Quick Start
1) Backend (Mock Server)
Path: backend-offline-app/
Endpoints:
GET /health – health check
GET /progress – returns { users, progress }
POST /sync – accepts { users: string[], progress: ProgressEntry[] } and persists to db.json
To Run it:

bash
cd backend-offline-app
npm install
npm run start
# Server runs on http://localhost:4000
2) App (Expo)
Path: offline-app-example/
Set backend URL by creating a .env file with a value
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.3:4000(put pc ip-address and make sure the phone and the pc are in the same network)
(for physical devices):
bash
# offline-app-example/.env (already used in this project)
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://<your-computer-ip>:4000
To Run it:

bash
cd offline-app-example
npm install
npx expo start
Open on iOS simulator, Android emulator, or Expo Go.

How to Use (Demo Flow)
Students tab
Create/select a student. The list shows a set of users (local + server) .
Toggle “Auto Sync on reconnect” to sync automatically when internet returns.
Activities tab
Tap “Refresh Questions” to generate 3 random math questions.
Answer and tap “Save Offline” to queue results locally.
Sync tab
“Health Check” verifies the backend.
“Refresh” shows the exact payload to be synced (users and queued progress) in a readable list.
“Sync Now” sends the payload to the backend and clears the local queue on success.
Connectivity banner
Shows a red banner while offline: “Offline: Saving locally. Sync when back online.”
When online, the banner stays hidden unless an auto-sync is in progress (green banner briefly).
Features Implemented
Offline-first data entry (no internet required for Students/Activities)
Local queueing of progress entries and manual/automatic sync
Unified users display (server + local) with deterministic IDs per name (for demo)
Random activities with quick refresh
Simple, readable UI using basic React Native components

Data Model (Simplified)
User: stored as string (name). For display, the app derives a deterministic id from the name (demo-only).
ProgressEntry:
ts
{
  id?: string;                  // generated by server if not provided
  user: string;                 // user name
  activityId: string;           // e.g., "q1", "q2", "q3"
  answer?: string | null;
  correct?: boolean | null;
  timestamp: string;            // ISO
}
The backend avoids duplicates by user + activityId + timestamp.

Offline Sync Logic
All writes are saved locally first (queued).
Manual sync: done via the Sync tab.
Auto-sync: when internet returns, if “Auto Sync on reconnect” is enabled and the queue is non-empty, the app syncs automatically.
Offline Data Layer Choice
This demo uses AsyncStorage for simplicity and portability with Expo managed workflow. In a production educational app, I’d replace this with react-native-mmkv or SQLite to improve performance and reliability for larger datasets. However, the offline sync logic and architecture are fully compatible with those storages.

Tech Choices
App: Expo Router, React Native, @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, @react-native-community/netinfo, @expo/vector-icons
Backend: Express, CORS, JSON file storage (db.json)
Notes for Evaluators
The UI is intentionally minimal to highlight functionality and architecture.
Users from the server are merged into local users to avoid duplicates; the Students list is unified.
The connectivity banner appears only when offline or while an auto-sync is in progress.
Troubleshooting
Using a physical device? Set EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL to your computer’s LAN IP.
If the Sync tab can’t reach the backend, verify the server is running and accessible on the same network.
If you switch to another storage (MMKV/SQLite), app/storage.ts is the only file that primarily needs changes.
